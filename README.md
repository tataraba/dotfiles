## About <a name = "about"></a>

I decided to invest a little time in making my coding environment a little more pleasant. These are some of my personal dotfiles.

## Tools <a name = "tools"></a>

- [Starship](https://starship.rs) - Customizable prompt for any shell
- [just](https://just.systems/man/en/introduction.html) - Command runner inspired by `make`
- [direnv](https://direnv.net) - Loads and unloads environment variables depending on current directory
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager



## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Most of these can be placed in your home (`~/`) directory. However, the `.bashrc` file should only be appended to existing `.bashrc`, and the `gitignore` file should change to `.gitignore`.

There's a better way to do this, but kinda works for now.
